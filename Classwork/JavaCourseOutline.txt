Using Operators and Decision Constructs
* Use Java operators; use parentheses to override operator precedence
* Test equality between Strings and other objects using == and equals ()

* Compare loop constructs
* Use break and continue
Java Class Design
* Create methods with arguments and return values; including overloaded methods
* Apply the static keyword to methods and fields
* Determine the effect upon object references and primitive values when they are passed  into methods that change the values
* Create and overload constructors
* Differentiate between default and user defined constructors
Working with Selected classes from the Java API
* Manipulate data using the StringBuilder class and its methods
* Create and manipulate Strings

* Write a simple Lambda expression that consumes a Lambda Predicate expression
Encapsulation
* Apply access modifiers to class and class members
* Apply encapsulation principles to a class
Inheritance
* Describe inheritance and its benefits
* Develop code that overrides methods
* Implement inheritance including visibility modifiers and composition
* Determine when casting is necessary
* Use super and this to access objects and constructors
* Develop code that uses abstract classes and methods
Polymorphism
* Describe Interfaces
* Differentiate between the type of a reference and the type of an object
* Describe polymorphism
* Develop code that makes use of polymorphism
* Override hashCode, equals, and toString methods from Object class
* Create and use singleton classes and immutable classes
* Develop code that uses static keyword on initialize blocks, variables, methods, and classes
Advanced Java Class Design
* Make overview of Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
* Develop code that uses the final keyword
* Create inner classes including static inner class, local class, nested class, and anonymous inner class
* Develop code that declares, implements and/or extends interfaces and use the @Override annotation.

Handling Exceptions
* Differentiate among checked exceptions, unchecked exceptions, and Errors
* Create a try-catch block and determine how exceptions alter normal program flow
* Describe the advantages of Exception handling
* Create and invoke a method that throws an exception
* Recognize common exception classes (such as NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, ClassCastException)
* Use catch, multi-catch, and finally clauses
* Use Autoclose resources with a try-with-resources statement
* Create custom exceptions and Auto-closeable resources
* Test invariants by using assertions

Generics and Collections
* Create and use a generic class
* Create and use ArrayList, TreeSet, TreeMap, and ArrayDeque objects
* Use java.util.Comparator and java.lang.Comparable interfaces
* Collections Streams and Filters
* Iterate using forEach methods of Streams and List
* Describe Stream interface and Stream pipeline
* Filter a collection by using lambda expressions
* Use method references with Streams
* Use enumerated types including methods, and constructors in an enum type

Lambda Built-in Functional Interfaces
* Create and use Lambda expressions
* Use  the built-in interfaces included in the java.util.function package such as Predicate, Consumer, Function, and Supplier
* Develop code that uses primitive versions of functional interfaces
* Develop code that uses binary versions of functional interfaces
* Develop code that uses the UnaryOperator interface
Java Stream API
* Develop code to extract data from an object using peek() and map() methods including primitive versions of the map() method
* Search for data by using search methods of the Stream classes including findFirst, findAny, anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch
* Develop code that uses the Optional class
* Develop code that uses Stream data methods and calculation methods
* Sort a collection using Stream API
* Save results to a collection using the collect method and group/partition data using the Collectors class
* Use flatMap() methods in the Stream API
Use Java SE 8 Date/Time API
* Create and manage date-based and time-based events including a combination of date and time into a single object using LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, Instant, Period, and Duration
* Work with dates and times across timezones and manage changes resulting from daylight savings including Format date and times values
* Define and create and manage date-based and time-based events using Instant, Period, Duration, and TemporalUnit
Java I/O Fundamentals
* Read and write data from the console
* Use BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, File, FileReader, FileWriter, FileInputStream, FileOutputStream, ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream, and PrintWriter in the java.io package.
Java File I/O (NIO.2)
* Use Path interface to operate on file and directory paths
* Use Files class to check, read, delete, copy, move, manage metadata of a file or directory
* Use Stream API with NIO.2
Java Concurrency
* Create worker threads using Runnable, Callable and use an ExecutorService to concurrently execute tasks
* Identify potential threading problems among deadlock, starvation, livelock, and race conditions
* Use synchronized keyword and java.util.concurrent.atomic package to control the order of thread execution
* Use java.util.concurrent collections and classes including CyclicBarrier and CopyOnWriteArrayList
* Use parallel Fork/Join Framework
* Use parallel Streams including reduction, decomposition, merging processes, pipelines and performance.
Building Database Applications with JDBC
